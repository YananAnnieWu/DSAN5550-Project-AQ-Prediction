# DSAN5550 Project - Air Quality Prediction in Los Angeles

## Overview
This project aims to predict daily air quality indicators (e.g., PM2.5, NO₂, CO) in Los Angeles by integrating **meteorological**, **human mobility**, and **pollution** datasets.
The goal is to build short-term machine learning models that capture rapid changes in air quality and explore how mobility patterns (especially during 2020-2022) affected pollution levels.

## Data Sources
- **Air Quality:** EPA Air Quality System (AQS) - Los Angeles station (2020-2024)
- **Weather:** NOAA daily meteorological data
- **Mobility:** Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports (Los Angeles County, 2020-2022)

## Current Status
The intermediate check-in demonstrates a **working end-to-end pipeline**.
